### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Food & Drink
- **Mobile:** This app is intended for mobile devices using android operating system. 
- **Story:** Users can capture an image of their fridge or pantry to detect ingredients that can be used in various recipes. 
- **Market:** This app is open to users of all ages.
- **Habit:** This app could be used daily for each meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner) of the day. 
- **Scope:** First we would like users to use their camera to filter ingredients in generated recipes which helps eliminate food waste and decision fatigue. Large potential for business use by fitness trainers to create meal plans for their clients.
